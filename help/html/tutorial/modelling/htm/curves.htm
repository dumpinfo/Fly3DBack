<h1>Modelling with curves</h1>
<p>This tutorial explains how to build curves in 3D Studio MAX for Fly3D. These 
  are special types of curves, and the curve object plugin was created specifically 
  for making curves that integrate with Fly3D and take advantage of the engine's 
  dynamic LOD algorithms and other optimizations.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating a structure</h3>
<p>- In this step, a big box will be created and used as structure, which will 
  represent the level itself and will contain the curves to be exported on the 
  end of the tutorial.<br>
  - A box is created in our simple example with dimensions 1000x1000x400, as seen 
  below:<br>

<h3>Step 2: Inverting the normals</h3>
<p>- Now the box's normals should be inverted, making the inside space valid, 
  and the outside, invalid. Also, a '*' (asterisk) character must be added to 
  the beginning of the box's name (in our case, <i>structure</i>), so that the 
  export plugin will later recognize it as the level's structure.<br>

<h3>Step 3: Mapping</h3>
<p>- In this step, the box will be texturized for a better look, which is completely 
  optional.<br>

<h3>Step 4: Creating curves</h3>
<p>- The Fly3D curve creation plugin is found inside the <i>Create/Geometry</i> 
  menu, in the <i>Paralelo</i> category.<br>
  - Clicking on the <i>flycurve</i> button, various curve types will will be available, 
  like cylinders, cones, spheres, caps, etc. Also, some options are available 
  like the dimensions and number os segments of the curve.<br>
  - Firstly, a cylinder will be created as a <i>Full</i> one (<i>4x1</i> segments), 
  positioned at the center of the room, with dimensions set at 50x50x200.<br>
	<img src="../img/flycurve05.jpg" width="356" height="257" align="bottom"><img src="../img/flycurve06.jpg" width="157" height="295" align="top"><br>
  - Now a quarter-sphere will be created, positioned anywhere in the room. A quarter-sphere 
  is created by selecting <i>hemisphere</i> in the <i>type</i> menu, and then 
  <i>Quarter (1x1)</i> in the <i>Segments</i> menu. Its dimensions will be 200x200x100, 
  as seen in the figure below:<br>
	<img src="../img/flycurve07.jpg" width="356" height="257" align="bottom">
	<img src="../img/flycurve08.jpg" width="158" height="289" align="top"><br>
	<br>
  - This time, another kind of curve will be created. In the <i>type</i> menu, 
  the <i>Cone</i> option will be selected, and a <i>Full (4x1)</i> cone will be 
  created, with dimensions 50x50x100 and posicioned against the wall, as seen 
  in the figure below:<br>
	<img src="../img/flycurve09.jpg" width="356" height="257">
	<img src="../img/flycurve10.jpg" width="154" height="289" align="top"><br>
	<br>
  - The next step is to make a capped thin half-cylinder. First, the body of a 
  half-cylinder must be created with dimensions set to 200x200x20.<br>
	<img src="../img/flycurve11.jpg" width="356" height="257">
<img src="../img/flycurve12.jpg" width="156" height="289" align="top"></p>
<p>- Now the cylinder must be cloned and placed on the same position, but this 
  time the <i>Cap Up</i> option of the <i>Part</i> menu must be used to make a 
  cap for the cylinder, as seen below:<br>
  <img src="../img/flycurve13.jpg" width="356" height="257"> <img src="../img/flycurve14.jpg" width="151" height="78" align="top"><br>
</p>
<h3>Step 5: Editing the curves</h3>
<p></p>
<p>- In this step, another cylinder will be created, and the <i>Edit Mesh</i> 
  modifier will be applied to it afterwards, making it possible to move the curve's 
  vetices. A <i>Full (4x1)</i> cylinder will be created, and the <i>Part</i> menu 
  must be set to <i>Body</i>.<br>
  - The <i>Edit Mesh</i> modifier is then applied, and the vertices are edited 
  to make it for a curved cylinder. Note that, once the modifier is applied, the 
  curve is no more visible; its control points appear instead. The vertices we 
  move are actually the curve's control points, but in Fly3D it will still be 
  seen as a curve.<br>
  <i><img src="../img/flycurve15.jpg" width="356" height="257"></i></p>
<p>- This last curve will be another cylinder (a quarter-cylinder, actually), 
  but this time we will set the <i>Invert Normals</i> option to make a rounded 
  corner. This quarter-cylinder will have dimensions of 200x200x200.<br>

<h3>Step 6: Illuminating, adding entities and exporting</h3>
<p>- In this last step, lights and a birthpad are positioned in the level.<br>
	<img src="../img/flycurve16.jpg" width="356" height="257"><br>
  - Export it as a Fly3D Map file (.fmp), build the level with flyBuilder and 
  run one of the engine's front-ends to see the level. Here are some screenshots 
  from the level in Fly3D:<br>
