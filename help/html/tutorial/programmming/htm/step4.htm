<h1>4. Creating a .fly file with flyEditor including the new plugin</h1>
<p>Now that the plugin has been successfully created, this step consists of creating 
  a new .fly file and including the plugin in it with the <b>flyEditor</b> front-end.</p>
<p>First of all, <b>flyEditor.exe </b>must be run. It is located in the Fly3D 
  installation folder. In the 'File' menu, the 'Save' sub-menu option must be 
  used to save a new .fly file. Saving is necessary for loading a BSP file to 
  the scene.</p>

<p>After saving the .fly file, a BSP must be loaded. This is achieved by editing 
  the 'bspfile' parameter in the 'Global' group (select the 'Global' item in the 
  tree-view on the left, then look for the 'bspfile' in the list-view on the center).</p>
<p>Now, the DLL generated by the 'Tutorial1' plugin must be inserted in the .fly 
  file. The plugin must be compiled and its resulting DLL file copied to the 'plugin' 
  folder in the Fly3D installation path. Then it can be inserted in the .fly file 
  by right-clicking on the 'Plugins' item in the tree-view on the left, and selecting 
  'Insert'. A dialog-box will appear and the DLL file must be chosen. The final 
  look of the file in <b>flyEditor</b> must be like this:</p>
