<h1>3. Creating a Fly3D plugin with the Visual C++ Wizard implementing two classes: 
  camera and object</h1>
<p>In this step, a new Fly3D plugin will be created from scratch, using the Visual 
  C++ Plugin Wizard.</p>
<p>First of all, Visual C++ must be run. In the 'File' menu, the 'New' sub-menu 
  will open a window for choosing the kind of document to be created. Fly3D Plugin 
  Wizard should be enumerated in the 'Projects' tab. It must be selected, a name 
  must be given to the new project (in this case, 'Tutorial 1') and a folder must 
  be chosen for the project to be saved in it. If Fly3D Plugin Wizard is not included 
  in the list, the plugins installation program can be run again for the proper 
  installation of the Wizard. <b>flyInstPlugins.exe</b> can be found inside the 
  'util' folder in the Fly3D installation directory. Refer back to <a href="step2.htm">step 
  2</a> for more info on installing the Plugin Wizard.</p>
<p>In the first step of the Plugin Wizard, the classes must be named and added 
  to the plugin. In this tutorial, two classes will be created: 'object' and 'camera'.

<p>In the second step, all parameters exported by the classes in the plugin must 
  be enumerated: their name, type and default value must be specified. Every parameter 
  must be of one of Fly3D predefined types, enumerated in the correspondent combo-box.</p>
<p>In our tutorial, the 'camera' class will have 2 parameters: 'mousevel' (a floating 
  point number that defines the velocity of mouse-look) and 'movevel' (another 
  floating point defining the velocity of camera movement). The 'object' class 
  will have only 1 parameter, 'objmesh', of type 'f3d static mesh', that will 
  be the triangular mesh of the object.</p>

<p>The third and last step of the wizard consists simply of selecting the Fly3D 
  installation path. </p>
<p>After all this, Fly3D Plugin Wizard must have created 3 files in your project: 
  'Tutorial1.h', 'Tutorial1.cpp' and 'Tutorial1.def'. The header file now contains 
  all the information enumerated in the steps 1 and 2 of the Plugin Wizard: the 
  classes and their parameters.</p>
