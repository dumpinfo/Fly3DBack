<h1>2. Installing Fly3D, 3DSMax plugins and Visual C++ Wizard</h1>
<p>Fly3D installation is as simple as follows: run the installation executable 
  and follow the instructions on choosing the installation folder, etc. </p>
<p>After the copy of all the files, <b>flyConfig.exe</b> will run automatically, 
  for the user to choose a graphics renderer, set some rendering options, configure 
  profile and keyboard mappings, and much more. For the renderer, an accelerated 
  mode should be selected.</p>

<p>After configurations are saved and <b>flyConfig.exe</b> is closed, the plugins 
  installation program (<b>flyInstPlugins.exe</b>) will also run automatically. 
  This software lets the user install Fly3D import and export plugins for 3D Studio 
  MAX 3.x or 4.x and the Visual C++ Plugin Wizard. For the installation of the 
  MAX plugins, the correct 3DSMax version and installation path must be selected. 
  For the Plugin Wizard, just the Visual C++ path is needed.</p>

  which he must do for the installation proccess to be finally complete.</p>
