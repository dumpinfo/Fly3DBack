<h1>Parameter Editor: flyEditor.exe </h1>
<p>As a software development kit, Fly3D 2.0 offers frontends and utilities that 
  work as development tools to facilitate content creation and integration of 
  the art material with the game or application executables. <b>flyEditor.exe</b> 
  is one of the most important and useful tools of these. It can create a new 
  .fly file or open an existing one, and serves for editing global or engine variables, 
  loading plugins, creating objects, activating them, editing parameters in any 
  object, be it active or not, and much more. <b>flyEditor.exe</b> also features 
  a rendering window where the simulation of the currently open .fly file is executed 
  and viewed, making it possible to modify parameters and see the results on-the-fly.</p>
<p><b>flyEditor.exe</b> has a window menu with various options, and its window 
  is divided in three parts: the <i>tree view</i>, the <i>list view</i> and the 
  <i>render view</i>. All these items are discussed in the following sessions:</p>
<h3>The Window Menu</h3>
<p><b>flyEditor.exe</b> features a complete window menu, with useful options like 
  creating or loading a .fly file, copying and pasting of objects and parameter 
  values, simulation options, and much more. Most commands, specially in the <i>Edit</i> 
  submenu, are also available by right-clicking the desired object.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor1.gif" width="238" height="222"></p>
<p>The <i>File</i> submenu has several items: <i>New</i> creates a new .fly file 
  from scratch; <i>Open</i> opens a previously created .fly file; <i>Save</i> 
  and <i>Save As </i>save the currently loaded file; <i>Revert to Saved</i> throws 
  away all modifications made to the currently loaded .fly file and re-opens the 
  previously saved version of the file; <i>Restart</i> restarts the simulation; 
  <i>Save Fly3D.ini</i> saves the initialization variable values on the 'Fly3D.ini' 
  file; a <i>list of recently loaded .fly files</i> for quick opening; and the 
  <i>Exit</i> option, which closes the application.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor2.gif" width="141" height="159"></p>
<p>The <i>Edit</i> submenu includes menu items for dealing with objects, like 
  the <i>Cut</i>, <i>Copy</i> and <i>Paste</i> commands; the <i>Duplicate</i> 
  item makes a copy of the currently selected object in the tree view, and pastes 
  it in the same hierarchical position of the original object; <i>Insert</i> can 
  be used in two ways: to insert a new plugin, .f3d object or texture (if any 
  of these three tree view root items is selected) or to create a new instance 
  of a class (if a class inside a plugin is selected instead); <i>Delete/Clear</i> 
  can be used to delete all instances of the selected class or to remove the selected 
  plugin from the scene; <i>Rename</i> can be used to rename any class instance 
  in the simulation.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor3.gif" width="122" height="102"></p>
<p>The <i>View</i> submenu has 4 options related to viewing and rendering: <i>Object 
  Only</i> focuses the camera on the selected object and draws it as seen in the 
  simulation; <i>Simulate</i> turns the simulation on/off; <i>Toolbar</i> and 
  <i>Status Bar</i> toggle the respective controls on/off.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor4.gif" width="127" height="41"></p>
<p>And finally, the <i>Help</i> submenu has only one item: <i>About flyEditor</i>, 
  which displays information concerning the development of the application and 
  copyright issues.</p>
<h3>The Toolbar Menu</h3>
<p>Right below the window menu is a toolbar with useful buttons for quick access 
  to some functions of <b>flyEditor.exe</b>. Most of them are also accessible 
  through the window menu.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor8.gif" width="382" height="25"></p>
<p>The complete list of buttons and the action each of them perform, in the correspponding 
  order that they are placed in the toolbar, from left to right, can be found 
  below: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <i>New</i>, <i>Open</i> and <i>Save</i> buttons correspond to the options 
    with the same name found in the <i>File</i> submenu of the window menu;</li>
  <li><i>SR</i> (<i>Save and Restart</i>) saves the current .fly file and reloads 
    it right after, restarting the simulation;</li>
  <li><i>RV</i> (<i>Revert to Saved</i>) matches the option with the same name 
    in the <i>File</i> submenu of the window menu;</li>
  <li><i>Cut</i>, <i>Copy</i>, <i>Paste</i> and <i>Duplicate</i> work the same 
    way as their counterparts in the <i>Edit</i> submenu of the window menu;</li>
  <li>The <i>Arrow Up</i> and <i>Arrow Down</i> buttons are used to change the 
    order in which the classes are displayed below the corresponding DLL item 
    in the tree view;</li>
  <li>The <i>Object Only</i> and <i>Simulate</i> buttons are switches, in the 
    same way as the options with the same name in the <i>View</i> submenu of the 
    window menu;</li>
  <li>The <i>About</i> button displays information about the development of <b>flyEditor.exe</b> 
    and its copyright.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Tree View</h3>
<p>The leftmost part of the <b>flyEditor.exe</b> window is the <i>tree view</i>. 
  A tree view is a Windows control that displays items organized as a hierarchy. 
  <b>flyEditor.exe</b>'s tree view displays several basic items (the &quot;root-items&quot;), 
  that can be expanded to show subitems. Upon selecting an item on the tree view, 
  the list view beside it is updated, displaying a list of parameters corresponding 
  to the selected item. Each of the root items, as well as the subitems appliable 
  to them, are discussed below.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor5.gif" width="226" height="418"></p>
<p>The <i>Global</i> root item represents Fly3D global and flyEngine's variables. 
  When this item is selected, all the variables and their values are displayed 
  in the list view, making it possible to modify them.</p>
<p>The <i>Plugins</i> root item represents all the plugin DLLs, classes and instances 
  that exist in the currently loaded .fly file. After selecting the <i>Plugins</i> 
  root item, it is possible to insert a new plugin DLL to the simulation. Any 
  DLLs present in the current file are displayed one level inside the <i>Plugins</i> 
  root item. One level further are the classes implemented in each plugin DLL. 
  These can be selected for creating a new instance of the class, as a stock object. 
  The existing instances of a given class are represented by subitems below the 
  class item in the hierarchy, and can be selected for modifying their parameters, 
  which appear in the list view.</p>
<p>The <i>Objects</i> root item represents all the .f3d and .k3d objects existing 
  in the currently loaded .fly file. Upon selecting it, all the .f3d and .k3d 
  objects in the file are displayed in the list view, together with some parameters 
  for them, like name, number of animations, etc.</p>
<p>The <i>Sounds</i> root item represents all the sound files existing in the 
  currently loaded .fly file. Upon selecting it, all the sound files are displayed 
  in the list view, together with some parameters for them, like name, length, 
  format, etc.</p>
<p>The <i>Textures</i> root item represents the whole set of textures applied 
  to the faces in the currently loaded level. Upon selecting it, all the textures 
  and lightmaps are displayed in the list view, together with some of their parameters, 
  like name, size, etc.</p>
<p>The <i>Shaders</i> root item represents all shaders applied to the faces in 
  the currently loaded level. Upon selecting it, all the shaders are displayed 
  in the list view, together with some of their parameters, like name, number 
  of passes, etc.</p>
<h3>The List View</h3>
<p>The central part of the <b>flyEditor.exe</b> window houses the <i>list-view</i>. 
  A list view is a Windows control that displays a table, where the lines represent 
  items of data and the columns represent fields in which items' parameters are 
  represented. </p>
<p>Depending on the item selected in the tree view, the list view can display 
  parameters relative to a given instance of a class, as an active or stock object; 
  a list of textures, shaders, sounds or .f3d and .k3d mesh objects; or a list 
  of global variables.</p>
<p><img src="../img/editor6.gif" width="247" height="411"></p>
<p>When displaying a list of object parameters, the list view enumerates them 
  and displays their values; by double-clicking the left mouse button on a parameter, 
  the corresponding value edition dialog box is displayed, and the parameter's 
  value can be changed.</p>
<p>When displaying a list of textures, shaders or .f3d and .k3d files, selecting 
  an item displays the corresponding texture or shader or mesh in the render view 
  to the right. These entities can be rotated by dragging the left mouse button 
  in the render view; zooming can also be performed, by dragging the right mouse 
  button on the render view.</p>
<p>When displaying a list of sounds, double-clicking the left mouse button on 
  a sound plays the corresponding .wav file.</p>
<h3>The Stock/Active Objects Menu</h3>
<p>Finally, on the upper rightmost part of <b>flyEditor.exe</b> is located the 
  <i>Stock and Active Objects</i> menu. Here, it is possible to create active 
  objects from stock objects, inserting them into the simulation. Also, this menu 
  allows the selection of active objects created from a given stock object. It 
  is also possible to destroy an active object, removing it from the simulation 
  immediately. </p>
<p><img src="../img/editor7.gif" width="323" height="28"></p>
<p>When an instance of a class is selected in the tree-view, the list view displays 
  a list of parameters corresponding to the respective stock object. If the <i>Active 
  Objects</i> check box in the <i>Stock and Active Objects</i> menu is checked, 
  then the list view will display the list of parameters of the first active instance 
  of the object. With the <i>arrow buttons</i>, the current active object can 
  be changed. The <i>Activate</i> button creates a new active object as a clone 
  of the selected stock object; the <i>Destroy</i> button removes the currently 
  selected active object from the simulation.</p>
