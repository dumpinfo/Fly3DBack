<h1>Multiplayer Server: flyServer.exe </h1>
<p>Fly3D Engine implements multiplayer gaming in a client/server architecture, 
  using DirectPlay as a low-level messaging module. The engine provides a specific 
  application for creating a multiplayer games server in the local machine: <b>flyServer.exe</b>. 
  It is a simple command line program, which receives a .fly file name as a parameter, 
  and creates a multiplayer server running the scene defined by the specified 
  .fly file. The application's functionalities include listening for clients who 
  want to join the game, receiving multiplayer game messages, synchronizing the 
  game and re-sending acknowledgement messages and game state messages to the 
  clients, besides logging any in-game special events and maintaining coherence 
  among the clients' games.</p>
<p><b>flyServer.exe</b> usage is as simple as shown below:</p>
<p class="code">flyServer.exe flyfile gamename</p>
<p>In this example, <i>flyfile</i> should be replaced by the complete or relative 
  path and name of the .fly file containing the scene that will run on the server 
  and clients as well; <i>gamename</i> is simply a string naming the game created, 
  for other players to recognize it.</p>
