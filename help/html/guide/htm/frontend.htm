<H1>Front-ends </H1>
<P>Besides the SDK itself, Fly3D also offers a great number of front-end applications, that serve inumerous purposes. There are fornt-ends for adding, deleting and editing entities, manipulating shader effects, configuring the system, and much more. A complete list of these applications and a description of each of them is found below:</P>
<h3>flyFrontend.exe</h3>
<P>This is the main front-end application of the engine. It consists of a rendering 
  window, where simulation occurs, and a menu for opening .fly files. The full-screen 
  mode is a great way to see exactly what your game or application looks like. 
  By pressing F1 while in this front-end, we can run a menu where we can choose 
  single or multi-player modes, load a .fly file and start a simulation, or play 
  a pre-recorded demo file (for more information on .fly files, see the <A HREF="files.htm">Files 
  and File Formats</A> section). <B>FlyFrontend</B> also features a huge list 
  of options, like switching texture filtering modes, mip-mapping, wireframe mode, 
  mute, turning the PVS culling on or off, taking a screenshot, and much more. 
  Here is a list of all the options:</P>
<P>F1: Menu<BR>
F2: Mute<BR>
F3: Record Demo<BR>
F4: Take Screenshot<BR>
F5: Node-only Mode<BR>
F6: PVS Toggle<BR>
F7: Mip-Mapping Toggle<BR>
F8: Texture Filtering Toggle<BR>
F9: Multitexture Toggle<BR>
F10: Stencil Toggle<BR>
F11: Wireframe Toggle<BR>
F12: Clear Background</P>
<h3>flyEditor.exe</h3>
<P>This is the main editing tool in Fly3D. It consists of a tree-view, where all 
  entities of the scene are displayed and categorized; a list-view, where parameters 
  are shown and edited; and a rendering window, where we can see our game or application 
  in action. <B>flyEditor</B> allows on-the-fly parameter change visualization, 
  that is, we change a value in the list-view and see the results in the rendering 
  view. We can also load additional plugins to use in our game or application, 
  add and delete entities, modify existing ones, and save a .fly file with all 
  these configurations.</P>
<h3>flyShader.exe</h3>
<P>This is the shader effects editing tool. With it, we can load the entire shaders 
  list (a .shr file) of a given scene, edit the effects and see the shader in 
  action in the rendering window. We can also load a .f3d mesh object, edit its 
  shader and see it animating. For more information on .shr and .f3d files, see 
  the <A HREF="files.htm">Files and File Formats</A> section. We can even apply 
  vertex programs to the mesh, using a script file. <B>flyShader</B> features 
  all the possible shader effects for a maximum of 8 shader passes, with alpha 
  channel blending, RGB generation functions, animation maps consisting of various 
  key-frames, scrolling, rotation and scaling of textures, environment mapping, 
  texture clamping, and much more.</P>
<h3>flyServer.exe</h3>
<P>This is the stand-alone console multi-player server. We should call it from 
  within <B>flyFrontend</B>, through the 'Multiplayer' menu option, to create 
  a server for the desired scene. Then, players connect to the server using the 
  'connect' console command or from the <B>flyFrontend</B> menu.</P>
<h3>fly3d.ocx</h3>
<P>This is Fly3D ActiveX Control. With it, the whole Fly3D Engine is available 
  for in-browse applications, such as Web 3D games, 3D browsing, 3D virtual shopping, 
  3D presentations, and much more. We just needs to build a HTML file with <B>Fly3d.ocx</B> 
  inside it, and use the control's commands to load .fly files and start the 3D 
  simulation. More about .fly files in the <A HREF="files.htm">Files and File 
  Formats</A> page.</P>
